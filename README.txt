2.) Description: 

My program creates and provides functionality for a hash table that can hold data in the form of node that contain both a key and a value. The
key will then be mapped/hashed to a specific index in the hash table. Some functionalities include looking up a specific key for its value, 
removing a node from the hash table, adding a new node to the table, checking if the table is empty, and freeing dynamic memory used in the table.

3.) Instructions:

To run my code first type "make" into the terminal.

Then type "./test_ht" to run the program. 

Then the output will be printed to the terminal where you can see the tests and results of my functionalities.

4.) Limitaions:
